# Admin API

Pasion provides a REST-like API for administrators to manage the service.
This API is intended to build tools on top of Pasion, and is only available to administrators.

## Enabling the API

The API isn't exposed by default, and must be added to either a public or a private HTTP listener.
It is considered safe to expose the API to the public, as access to it is gated by the `urn:pasion:admin` scope (the legacy `urn:mas:admin` scope is also accepted for backward compatibility).

To enable the API, tweak the [`http.listeners`](../reference/configuration.md#httplisteners) configuration section to add the `adminapi` resource:

```yaml
http:
  listeners:
    - name: web
      resources:
        # Other public resources
        - name: discovery
        # …
        - name: adminapi
      binds:
        - address: "[::]:8080"
    # or to a separate, internal listener:
    - name: internal
      resources:
        # Other internal resources
        - name: health
        - name: prometheus
        # …
        - name: adminapi
      binds:
        - host: localhost
          port: 8081
```

## Reference documentation

The API is documented using the [OpenAPI specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0).
The API schema is available [here](../api/spec.json).
This schema can be viewed in tools like Swagger UI, available [here](../api/).

If admin API is enabled, Pasion will also serve the specification at `/api/spec.json`, with a Swagger UI available at `/api/doc/`.

## Authentication

All requests to the admin API are gated either using access tokens obtained using OAuth 2.0 grants,
or using personal access tokens (which must currently be issued through the Admin API).

They must have the [`urn:pasion:admin`](../reference/scopes.md#urnpasionadmin) scope (or the legacy [`urn:mas:admin`](../reference/scopes.md#urnmasadmin) scope).

### User-interactive tools

If the intent is to build admin tools where the administrator logs in themselves, interactive grants like the [authorization code] grant or the [device authorization] grant should be used.

In this case, whether the user can request admin access or not is defined by the `can_request_admin` attribute of the user.

To try it out in Swagger UI, a client can be defined statically in the configuration file like this:

```yaml
clients:
  - client_id: 01J44Q10GR4AMTFZEEF936DTCM
    # For the authorization_code grant, Swagger UI uses the client_secret_post authentication method
    client_auth_method: client_secret_post
    client_secret: wie9oh2EekeeDeithei9Eipaeh2sohte
    redirect_uris:
      # The Swagger UI callback in the hosted documentation
      - https://palpo-im.github.io/pasion/api/oauth2-redirect.html
      # The Swagger UI callback hosted by the service
      - https://auth.example.com/api/doc/oauth2-callback
```

Then, in Swagger UI, click on the "Authorize" button.
In the modal, enter the client ID and client secret **in the `authorizationCode` section**, select the `urn:pasion:admin` scope and click on the "Authorize" button.

### Automated tools

Administrative scopes are only ever granted to administrator users, so the client credentials grant (which has no user) cannot be used to access the Admin API.

Tools that are not meant to be used by humans should instead use a personal access token acting as an administrator user.
Such a token can be created by an existing administrator with `POST /api/admin/v1/personal-sessions`:

```json
{
  "actor_user_id": "01J2KDPHTZYW3TAT1SKVAD63SQ",
  "human_name": "Provisioning bot",
  "scope": "urn:pasion:admin",
  "expires_in": 31536000
}
```

The token stops working as soon as the actor user loses its `admin` flag, is locked or is deactivated.
It is good practice to create a dedicated administrator user for each tool.


## General API shape

The API takes inspiration from the [JSON API](https://jsonapi.org/) specification for its request and response shapes.

### Single resource

When querying a single resource, the response is generally shaped like this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "type-of-the-resource",
    "id": "unique-id-for-the-resource",
    "attributes": {
      "some-attribute": "some-value"
    },
    "links": {
      "self": "/api/admin/v1/type-of-the-resource/unique-id-for-the-resource"
    }
  },
  "links": {
    "self": "/api/admin/v1/type-of-the-resource/unique-id-for-the-resource"
  }
}
```

### List of resources

When querying a list of resources, the response is generally shaped like this:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "count": 42
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "type-of-the-resource",
      "id": "unique-id-for-the-resource",
      "attributes": {
        "some-attribute": "some-value"
      },
      "links": {
        "self": "/api/admin/v1/type-of-the-resource/unique-id-for-the-resource"
      }
    },
    { "...": "..." },
    { "...": "..." }
  ],
  "links": {
    "self": "/api/admin/v1/type-of-the-resource?page[first]=10&page[after]=some-id",
    "first": "/api/admin/v1/type-of-the-resource?page[first]=10",
    "last": "/api/admin/v1/type-of-the-resource?page[last]=10",
    "next": "/api/admin/v1/type-of-the-resource?page[first]=10&page[after]=some-id",
    "prev": "/api/admin/v1/type-of-the-resource?page[last]=10&page[before]=some-id"
  }
}
```

The `meta` will have the total number of items in it, and the `links` object contains the links to the next and previous pages, if any.

Pagination is cursor-based, where the ID of items is used as the cursor.
Resources can be paginated forwards using the `page[after]` and `page[first]` parameters, and backwards using the `page[before]` and `page[last]` parameters.

### Error responses

Error responses will use a 4xx or 5xx status code, with the following shape:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "title": "Error title"
    }
  ]
}
```

Well-known error codes are not yet specified.

## Example

Assuming `ACCESS_TOKEN` holds a personal access token of an administrator user with the `urn:pasion:admin` scope (see [automated tools](#automated-tools)):

`curl` example to list the users that are not locked and have the `can_request_admin` flag set to `true`:

```bash
# List users (The -g flag prevents curl from interpreting the brackets in the URL)
curl \
  -g \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  'https://auth.example.com/api/admin/v1/users?filter[can_request_admin]=true&filter[status]=active&page[first]=100' \
  | jq
```
