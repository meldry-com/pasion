//! Account aggregate repository.
//!
//! This module provides a unified read interface over contact points, identity
//! bindings, and security events for a given user account. Instead of reaching
//! into `UserEmailRepository`, `UserPhoneRepository`,
//! `UpstreamOAuthLinkRepository`, and `AuditRepository` separately, callers
//! can use [`AccountRepository`] to get a coherent view suitable for the user
//! portal.
